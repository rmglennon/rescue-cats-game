# Rescue the Cats Game

In this game, you need to rescue the cats, but they will escape if you get too many at once!

 ## Game rules

 You will be given a random number of cats to rescue at the start of the game.

 When you click any of the cat images, you will collect and rescue a specific number of cats. You win the game by collecting the same number of cats as the number needing rescue. You lose if you rescue too many cats and they escape!

 The value of each cat click is hidden from you until you click on it. Each time the game starts, the values of the cats and the number needing to be rescued will change.
